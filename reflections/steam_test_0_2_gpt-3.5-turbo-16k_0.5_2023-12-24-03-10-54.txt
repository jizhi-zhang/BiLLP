The user did not respond positively to the final recommendation and quit. One possible reason for this failure could be that the user was not interested in adventure games. To mitigate this failure, the next time I recommend to a user, I should consider their specific preferences and recommend a diverse range of games across different genres, rather than focusing solely on their previous viewing history. This will help ensure that the user does not get bored and will increase the likelihood of them being satisfied with the recommendations.
The user did not respond positively to the recommendation of Gone Home, which suggests that they may not enjoy exploration-based games as much as initially thought. In the future, I should be more cautious when inferring preferences and consider a wider range of game genres that the user may enjoy.
