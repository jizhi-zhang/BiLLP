The user has shown a clear preference for action role-playing games, strategy games, and adventure games. However, the agent failed to recognize this and recommended games from different genres, resulting in dissatisfaction. In the next trial, the agent should prioritize recommending games from the preferred genres and only suggest games from other genres if the user has shown interest in them previously.
The user did not respond positively to the final recommendation, resulting in a negative reward. One possible reason for this failure could be that the user was not interested in trying out a game that combines different genres. To mitigate this failure in the future, I should consider the user's specific preferences for genre combinations and recommend games that align with those preferences. Additionally, I should monitor the user's feedback and adjust the recommendations accordingly to ensure a higher level of satisfaction.
