Additionally, the agent can also incorporate user feedback and preferences to further personalize the recommendations and increase user satisfaction.
The user did not respond well to the final recommendation, resulting in a negative reward and the user quitting. One possible reason for this failure could be that the user has already read or is not interested in niche genre novels.

This will increase the likelihood of the user being interested in and satisfied with the recommendation.
The user became dissatisfied with the final recommendation as it did not align with their interests and preferences. They may have found the book to be uninteresting or irrelevant.

Additionally, it may be beneficial to gather more information about the user's preferences and reading habits to provide more accurate recommendations.
