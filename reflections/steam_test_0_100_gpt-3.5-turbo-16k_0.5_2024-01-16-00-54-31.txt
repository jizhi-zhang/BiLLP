To mitigate this failure, the new plan could involve incorporating user feedback and preferences into the recommendation process, such as allowing the user to provide explicit feedback on recommended items and using that feedback to refine future recommendations. Additionally, the agent could consider utilizing collaborative filtering techniques to analyze the preferences of similar users and make more personalized recommendations.
The user became dissatisfied with the final recommendation because it was too similar to the previous recommendations and did not offer a unique experience. The next time you recommend to a user, consider providing more diverse recommendations to prevent boredom and ensure user satisfaction.
The user became dissatisfied with the recommendations because they were not interested in certain genres, such as simulation games and racing games. The plan should have taken into account the user's specific preferences and avoided recommending games in genres they did not enjoy. In the future, the agent should focus on recommending games that align with the user's interests in survival and strategy genres, while also considering their preferences for open-world exploration games. The agent should also be more cautious about recommending games in genres the user has shown disinterest in, to avoid frustrating the user and improve retention.
